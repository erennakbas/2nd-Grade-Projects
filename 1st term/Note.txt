- These assignments are related with data structures. I found these assignments
very comprehensive and teaching. Assignment 1 was like an exercise for C++ and
we had a problem with assignment 2 due to our researcher assistant's 
not doing her work properly. So I just added assignment 3 and 4.

- Again, first see the assignment instructions from pdf and understand how to run
it, then run it. Every assignment is tested on our department's
dev server. I also got full credit from this software laboratory course (BBM203).
